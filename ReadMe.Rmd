###Course Project 
The class project for [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) was to read in [Smartphone Data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and clean it to produce a tidy data. 

<br> 

####Instructions 
1. Download [run_analysis.R] 
2. Run the script
3. Output is tidy.txt 

<br> 

####The following steps have been incorporated into the script

* Creation of a `data` folder in working directory to store files 
* Downloading project data in zip format, unzipping the files, and storing files in the `data` folder
* Detecting if the `dplr` and `data.table` package are installed. The script will install these packages if they are not already installed.
